base64 encoding, as known, is available to transmit data from binary, into (most commonly) ASCII characters so that it's more easily transmitted in things like 
e-mail and HTML form data. Due to the likeliness that the recieving end can handle ASCII, it makes it a nice way to transfer binary data via a text stream.
Your binary data could be screwed up because the underlying protocol might think that you've entered a special character combination. If your situation can handle 
native binary data, that will most likely yield better results, in terms of speed and such, but if not, base64 is most likely the way to go.
JSON is a great example of when you would benefit from this, or when it needs to be stored in a text field somewhere.
